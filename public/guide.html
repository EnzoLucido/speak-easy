  <h1>A Guide to Using SpeakEasy</h1>

  <p>To begin using SpeakEasy, simply press record. When you stop recording, SpeakEasy automatically analyzes your data.</p>

  <h2>Understanding What SpeakEasy Measures</h2>

  <h3>Mean Pitch (F0)</h3>
  <p>How "high" or "low" your voice is, on average.</p>

  <h3>Pitch Standard Deviation</h3>
  <p>A measure of how much your pitch varies.</p>

  <h3>Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR)</h3>
  <p>The clarity of a voice. Lower scores indicate a hoarseness or breathiness.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ“Š Visualized on the Chart</h2>

  <h3>Pitch</h3>
  <p>How "high" or "low" your voice was at each moment in the recording.</p>

  <h3>Formants (F1, F2, F3)</h3>
  <p>
    These are resonant frequencies shaped by the position of your tongue and lips:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>F1</strong>: Reflects how open your mouth is.</li>
    <li><strong>F2</strong>: Relates to where your tongue is in your mouth.</li>
    <li><strong>F3</strong>: Can reflect more nuanced vocal tract features, including lip rounding or speech clarity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Tracking these can help with precise vocal adjustments, especially in gender-affirming voice training.
    However, it is important to remember that you must use the same words to compare changes.
  </p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <p>Voice analysis is very susceptible to noise, so if you see something that looks like an outlier, it probably is!</p>
  <p>Some words are naturally higher than others, so it can be useful to compare saying the same words to one another.</p>
